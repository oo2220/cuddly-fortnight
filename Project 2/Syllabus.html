                Course Description <br>
                Coding for Spatial Practices introduces students to web design and development as a 
                means of representation, speculation and communication. Students will learn the 
                foundational, front-end languages HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create work for the web browser.
                <br>
                <br>
                To guide our study, we will explore questions such as: What is the relationship
                between architecture and the World Wide Web? What parallels can be drawn between the
                development process and our own design processes?
                
                <br>
                <br>
                The class will consist of exercises and long-form projects which allow students to
                develop concepts, ideas, and strategies for web-based projects. These projects will be supplemented/contextualized by lectures, readings, 
                writing, and student-led groupdiscussions, to reinforce core concepts.
